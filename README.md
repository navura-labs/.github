## 🚀 Why Navura?

- 🌍 **Cross-border payroll** is slow, expensive, and lacks trust.
- 📜 **Resumes can be faked** — making hiring risky and time-consuming.
- 🔐 **HR records are sensitive** and need both privacy and verification.

**Navura solves this by combining encrypted payroll, NFT payslips, and verifiable resumes** into a one-stop HR platform.

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Encrypted Payroll (eERC20)** — salaries sent privately but with public proof.
- **NFT Payslips** — employees receive on-chain, verifiable salary records.
- **Job Marketplace** — connect employers & talent with blockchain validation.
- **Verifiable Resumes** — work history stored as tamper-proof NFTs.
